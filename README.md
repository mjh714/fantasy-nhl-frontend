To bring Hockey fans together this app is to see who is the best GM amongst friends.

**Note**
This project is not 100% complete from what I originally planned. I will not continue to work on this project. I realized that I need to incorperate Redux, I learned a lot from this project, it was very enjoyable, there were many times of frustration, but this project helped me grow a lot, working with this API was very simple so I thank you Josh, you did an amazing job with this gem.
